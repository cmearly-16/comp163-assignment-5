I decided to use the while loop for the first challenge because it required code that decided if a number was even or odd, and also the algorithm had a requirement that basically said, "while" n doesnt equal 1, continue the loop, so it made the most sense.
I used for loops in the 2nd challenge because I used range in my code to decide whether a input was prime or not, and for loops work because whenever I use the range function.

Finally in the 3rd challenge I used for nested loops in order to properly display the rows and columns together in the way zybooks wanted.
For challenge 1, as long as the number was not 1, the loop would keep running until the current number equaled 1, in which it would then display the amount of loops needed to reduce the input to 1.
For challenge 2, in order to determine if the input was prime or not, I automatically set prime to true, and I would see if the input divided by the number of items in the range equaled 0, and if it did, then it would convert prime to not true and display the output set.
For challenge 3, I used nested loops and "col" and "row", in order to make the table, and simply multiplied the numbers the rows and columns where assigned to receive the products needed to fill out the table.

I used chatgpt to help me determine how to properly code the table needed for challenge 3. It told me how to use "col" and "row" in my code, and gave some examples of what it would look like as code and as a output display.
